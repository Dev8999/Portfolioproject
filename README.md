COVID-19 took a toll on everyone's lives and was unfortunate that it took the lives of many people across the world. The thought behind choosing this dataset was to explore the data and take note of the countries which experience most number of deaths of the infected people and the perecentage of population who are affected and vaccinated to fight the virus.


Rows: 87743 Columns: 59

Many null values were found in the dataset. This has been taken into consideration during the analysis

Continent column contains names of continents. Location column contains names of continents and countries. While analyzing country wise data, it is important to exclude rows with location set to continent name.

## Importing Dataset Into SQL Server

It is recommended that SQL Server Import and Export Data (64 bit) wizard is launched from the Start Menu, and not the inbuilt option available within SSMS
